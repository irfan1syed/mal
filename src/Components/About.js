        <p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) has become a widely used standard for document exchange due to its portability and flexibility. However, these same qualities have made it a prime target for cybercriminals, who exploit vulnerabilities in the PDF format to distribute malicious code.This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based detection system that leverages feature extraction techniques, such as analyzing embedded JavaScript, file structure, and metadata, to distinguish between benign and malicious PDFs. This research aims to improve threat detection platforms by providing an adaptable solution for combating PDF-borne attacks through data-driven insights and advanced machine learning methodologies.
